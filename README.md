# Precept

A declarative Flutter application framework for use where forms are required

## Objectives

1. impose NO restrictions on the developer - they should be able to use the full power of Flutter for anything else they want in their app.
1. Minimise repetitive coding for data retrieval, form construction, validation and submission
1. Reduce app updates by declaring the model on the server-side
1. support multiple backends








## Build

``` bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch

```
