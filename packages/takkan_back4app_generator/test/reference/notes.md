# Reference Files

These provide the test reference for code generation

Under the 'reference' directory, each directory is labelled with a version number.
It contains the full set of files expected from the generator for that version of the medley_schema defined in *precept_script* 

There should not need to be many versions, the idea is to encompass everything that can be thought of in the schema structure, and test it,
with a couple of things changed between versions to check that part works
