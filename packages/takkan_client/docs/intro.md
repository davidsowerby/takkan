#  An Introduction to Precept

Flutter is an incredibly flexible and powerful toolset for creating apps on multiple platforms.

Precept attempts to build on that by providing an Application Framework for any app which needs
forms, wizards or even just a consistent layout.

It takes a declarative, JSON based, approach which also enables you to update apps from the server - 
this can be useful when your users are not updating when you want them to!

# Objectives

Precept has the following objectives:

1. Reduce the number of app updates needed, by generating part or all of an app's UI in Flutter using a declarative file sourced from a server.
1. Reduce the effort needed to code page layouts, forms and wizards, by using simplified declarations and re-usable elements.
1. Support multiple backends (for example Parse Server, Firebase)
1. Achieve the above without restricting the developer's access to native Flutter
1. Be Open Source for ever
