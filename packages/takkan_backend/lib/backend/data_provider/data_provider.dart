/// The layer between the client and server.
///
/// It provides a consistent data access interface regardless of the type of data provider used.
///
/// Selection of the active [IDataProvider] is through the use of [getIt] named
/// instances
///
/// Identification of a provider is provided by [config.instanceConfig], as
/// there may be the occasional requirement to work with two instances of the
/// same backend type,
///
/// If a call is not supported by an implementation, it will throw a [APINotSupportedException]
///
/// [init] must always be invoked before use
///
/// [fetchDocument] and [fetchDocumentList] call cloud functions known to return a
/// single document or list of documents respectively.  These cloud functions are
/// usually generated from the [Schema] by the *takkan_server_code_generator* but
/// could be user provided.
///
/// These are also used by [selectDocument] and [selectDocumentList], which use a
/// [DocumentSelector] to identify the query (and therefore cloud function) to
/// use to select a document or documents
///
/// [executeFunction] is used to executes any other cloud function, usually
/// user-provided.
///
/// Document CRUD functionality is provided by [createDocument], [readDocument],
/// [updateDocument] and [deleteDocument].  With the exception of creating a new document
/// all require a [DocumentId] to operate on a specific document.  A GraphQL script
/// can be executed using [executeGraphQL]
///
/// [documentIdFromData] returns a [DocumentId] from a document's data, and is
/// a backend-specific implementation
///
/// [latestScript] retrieves the latest Takkan [Script]
///
/// In addition to CRUD and function calls, an [IDataProvider] implementation
/// provides a backend-specific [Authenticator], where a user is required to authenticate.
/// The [Authenticator] contains a [user] object for this data provider, holding
/// basic user information and authentication status.  Shortcuts status calls
/// are available in [userIsAuthenticated] and [userIsNotAuthenticated].
///
/// A [userRoles] call invokes a cloud function provided by the Takkan framework
/// to returns roles for the authenticated [user].
///
/// This structure means that a client app can log in as a different user
/// for each [IDataProvider] it uses.
///
/// Different implementations will provide their own [objectIdKey] and
/// [sessionTokenKey]:
///
///  - [objectIdKey] The property of a document unique id ('objectId' in Back4App)
///  - [sessionTokenKey] the HTTP header key for the session token
