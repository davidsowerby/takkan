/// A [ParticleSwitch] combines field level data with the manner in which it is displayed.  It uses an [EditState]
/// instance (from the widget tree above) to determine whether it is in edit or read mode.
///
/// Data is connected directly to the Particles during the process of creating them,
/// see [PartLibrary.constructPart]
///
/// Implementations of Part determine which particles to use, along with configuration
/// from its associated Trait.  A Part implementation also provides a suitable builder.
///
/// The default situation (where [singleParticle] is false), uses two particles (just Widgets),
/// one for read mode and one for edit mode.  For example, a Text Widget is used for reading text,
/// and a [TextBox] for edit mode.
///
///
/// A [readParticle] is always required, and is displayed when in read mode (or the data is static).
/// The [editParticle] is displayed when in edit mode.
///
///
/// If [singleParticle] is true, it signifies that particle makes its own modification in response to
/// the current edit state.  In other words, it takes care of its own presentation when in either edit or read mode.
/// The particle is stored in [readParticle]
///
/// [config] is a [Part] instance, which is contained within a [Script].
