/// The whole of the [Script] structure is a tree, with a single [Script] instance at its root.
///
/// This [TakkanElement] is the base class for the major components of that tree.
///
/// [parent] is the parent [TakkanElement].
///
/// There are there types of id, used to support testing and debugging.
///
/// The [uid] is a unique id within the scope of of a [parent]
/// The [debugId] is a hierarchical 'path' id unique within the scope of a [Script] instance.
/// The hierarchical nature of this key enables means any particular [TakkanElement]
/// can be identified via its parent chain. This also becomes the Widget key of the
/// item's associated Widget, especially useful for functional testing.
///
/// A [_id] is optional and can be set by the constructor [id] parameter.
/// If set it overrides the generated [uid] and become part of the [debugId].
/// It is useful to identify a specific component, or where ambiguity arises from the use of [uid].
/// That is unlikely unless there are two components with the same caption or name.
///
/// - [_index] is the child index within a [_parent] where it is held in a list. Null if not used.
/// - [script] is a reference back to the root [Script] instance.
///
/// All properties except [_id] are generated during the [Script.init] process
/// The only persisted value is [_id] as all the others are generated.
///
/// Use of [Equatable] requires that all fields are final in order to meet
/// the contract of equality and immutability.  However, the descendants
/// of [TakkanElement] are designed for ease of definition by the developer. This
/// means, for example, specifying field names as the keys to a map, but then
/// setting [Field] names during [doInit].  This requires that some fields are
/// 'late' rather than 'final', but for good reason, so the linting has been
/// turned off for this issue in the relevant files.  Equality checks must also
/// therefore not be made until after [doInit] has been called via [Script.init].
///
/// Takkan testing of [Equatable] sub-classes is by ensuring that all properties are
/// listed in [Equatable.props].  However, there are legitimate cases where a property
/// should be excluded from equality comparison.  For test purposes only, an additional
/// getter `List<Object> get excludeProps` can be declared.  This is not an [Equatable]
/// feature, simply an aid for testing in Takkan
