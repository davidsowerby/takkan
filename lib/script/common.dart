/// Holds common properties for every level of a [Script], and its main purpose is to reduce manual configuration.
///
/// With the exception of [controlEdit] and[documentId] (described below), these properties are used to construct companion Widgets
/// in the [Widget Tree](https://www.takkanblog.co.uk/user-guide/widget-tree.html) as part of the build process.
/// In conjunction with Flutter and Provider, the resulting Widgets work on the basis of 'inheritance' - that is,
/// a higher level setting is used by all lower levels, unless overridden by a lower level setting.
///
/// [Script] and its constituents mimic this 'inheritance' structure for the purpose of validation.
///
/// - [dataProvider]
/// - [data-select]
/// - [textTrait] defines styles for all heading and text levels, derived from [ThemeData].  It would be called textStyle, but Flutter already uses that name
/// - [panelStyle] defines borders and other styling for panels
/// - [isStatic] which if true, means a [Part] takes its data from the [Script] and not a data source.
/// This also means that no [DataBinding] is needed.  Although this really only applies at [Part] level, it can be set
/// anywhere up to [Script] and take effect for all lower levels.
///
///
/// If an inherited property has no value set anywhere in the hierarchy, the [Script.validate] will flag an error
///
/// - [controlEdit] is treated slightly differently.
/// It determines whether an editing action is displayed (usually a pencil icon).
/// It is only relevant if the user has permission to edit (see [EditState.canEdit]).
/// A setting for [controlEdit] still overrides a setting higher up the hierarchy, but
/// has a number of possible settings defined by [ControlEdit], with the intention of making it
/// as easy as possible to specify what is wanted.  [hasEditControl] is computed during [Script.init]
/// from the combination of [controlEdit] settings at different levels, and determines whether
/// a [Page], [Panel] or [Part] can trigger an edit.  It also determines whether there is an associated [EditState] as shown in
/// the [User Guide](https://www.takkanblog.co.uk/user-guide/widget-tree.html)
///
/// - [documentId] combined with [objectId] are used to identify the item during validation, where no caption or title is defined.  It is also
/// used as a key in the corresponding, constructed Widget to aid functional testing.
///
/// - [script] provides a direct reference to the root [Script].  It is added during init
///
/// **NOTE** Calls to any of the getters will fail unless [init] has been called first, because the [_parent] property
/// is set only after a [init] call.  Unfortunately there seems to be no way to
/// set this during construction - this also means that the [Script] structure cannot be **const**
