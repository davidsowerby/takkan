# Back4App

## Client Side
The Back4App client side implementation contains implementations for [DataProvider](data-providers.md) and `PDataProvider`.

## Server Side

The Back4App server-side implementation provides a few Back4App Classes and cloud functions needed to make Precept work.

They are primarily there to enable the use of a single schema for both client and server side, through the use of [server side schema generation](server-side-schema-generation.md).

## Initialisation Process
Initialising a new Back4App instance goes through the following steps:
 
1. [Create a blank instance](https://www.back4app.com/docs/get-started/new-parse-app).  Note that an app to Back4App may be, say, the test, QA or prod instance for your app.
1. [Create a Precept app](create-precept-app.md)
1. Add dependency **precept_back4app_backend** to pubspec.yaml
1. From a terminal at the project root, execute the command line:

// TODO:  

```bash

```  

### Classes

Precept uses these classes:

| Class               | Purpose                                                                                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PreceptState        | Only ever has one row. Records the current version of client (PSchema), server and framework schemas in use. |
| PreceptStateHistory | A history of changes to PreceptState                                                             |


The framework schema is a rather grand title for ensuring changes to this simple Class structure can be managed, if they are ever needed.

Note that server schema is considered to **include validation code functions**, so there is currently no situation where the `PSchema` and server schemas should be operating at a different version.
 
Their versions are recorded separately just in case that ever needs to change.  

### Functions

#### initInstance

When a blank Back4App instance is first created, some preparation is needed to enable Precept to work.

The function code is uploaded from a client using the *initFramework* function provided by the *precept_back4app_backend* package.

:::tip Note

There is an [outstanding issue](https://gitlab.com/precept1/precept_back4app_backend/-/issues/7) to look at restructuring the *precept_back4app_backend* package.
:::


The *initInstance* function does the following:




Once invoked, this function cannot be called again, without deleting the **PreceptState** class
