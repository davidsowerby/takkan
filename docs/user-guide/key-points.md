- Automatically bind data to Widgets
- Automatically generate Edit / Save / Cancel logic
- A single schema for both client & server

Precept is about connecting data to widgets, and includes:

- Client side and server side validation from the same schema
- Role based access control, 
- Edit-save-cancel logic, 
- Generation of a server side schema,
- Extensible to include your own widgets
- No lock in - full access to Flutter
