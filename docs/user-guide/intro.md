# Overview

If you have not already, is is worth looking at the [Precept Overview](../intro.md), which provides a summary of Precept's features.

:::caution

This document is written as though functionality exists, even when it is still in development.  Linked tasks can be viewed via the icons.

## View and Model

Both the view, or presentation layer, and the model, or data, layer are defined by scripts.

## Scripts

A `PScript` provide a definition of what is to be displayed.  Within it, there are also definitions for [Data Providers](data-providers.md).  "Data Providers" is a general term for anything you might get data from. It could be your main application backend or a public REST API.

Ultimately there is a single `PScript` per app - although that single `PScript` may be created by merging multiple `PScript` instances to support modularity.

Simplistically, Precept acts as an interpreter of the `PScript` in order to provide the app itself.



### Loading Scripts

The scripts themselves can be loaded using a `RestLoader` [![task](../images/task.png)](https://gitlab.com/precept1/precept_client/-/issues/78) to retrieve the script from server, or a `DirectLoader`.

A `DirectLoader` just takes a locally defined variable and loads it - useful during development to avoid having to push the script to a server and then call it back again.

Scripts are generally cached locally to enable offline working.  [![task](../images/task.png)](https://gitlab.com/precept1/precept_client/-/issues/76) This does depend on the device the app is running on. 


### Version Control


Since changing a script changes functionality, scripts have versions to keep control.  [![task](../images/task.png)](https://gitlab.com/precept1/precept_client/-/issues/74) 


### Internationalization

Precept takes a slightly different approach to supporting multiple Locales. Instead of using a translation routine on the client, a script holds the appropriate I18N patterns as part of the script - a different script instance for each supported Locale.

This reduces the amount of translation needed on the client, although interpolation [![task](../images/task.png)](https://gitlab.com/precept1/precept_client/-/issues/79) of values, where required, can still only be carried out on the client.

## Pages, Panels and Parts

`PScript` defines `PPage` instances.  A `PPage` instance contains `PPanel` and `PPart` instances.  A `PPanel` may contain further `PPanel` instances, or `PPart` instances.

A `PPart` is simply a combination of two Widgets, one for reading and one for editing data.  This supports the generation of automatic [Edit-Save-Cancel](edit-save-cancel.md) logic. 


## The Build Process

`PScript` defines pages mapped to routes (where a route is just a String identifier).

When a `PreceptPage` is constructed it assembles its Panels and Parts as defined by `PScript`.  In doing so, it also creates [data bindings](data-bindings.md) from the resultant Widgets to the data itself.  The bindings also trigger any [validation](validation.md) defined by `PSchema`.

The data is identified by the `PDataProvider` and `PSchema` associated with the page.  


## Use with non-Precept pages

One of Precept's primary objectives is not to get in the way of the developer wanting to Flutter directly.

Precept offers two ways of merge Precept and non-Precept parts of an app.


1. The `PreceptRouter` configuration, `PreceptRouterConfig`, allows for an [alternate router](partial-use.md#alternate-router) 

1. Precept Panels can be embedded in any page.  [![task](../images/idea.svg)](https://gitlab.com/precept1/precept_client/-/issues/77)
