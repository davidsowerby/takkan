title: Takkan Overview
description: An Application Framework for Flutter.
---

## Objective

The objective of Takkan is to simplify some of the application structural design, while leaving the developer completely free to use the full power of Flutter.


## Concept

### Schema

At the heart of the Takkan framework is the `Schema`.  It allows app developers to define the application schema, with associated validations and permissions in one place, or if preferred, by combining various elements of a schema from different parts of the app:

```dart
final Schema schema = Schema(
        name: 'test',
        version: const Version(number: 0),
        documents: {
          'Person': Document(
            fields: {
              'firstName': FString(),
              'lastName': FString(),
              'age': FInteger(),
            },
            queries: {
              'adults': Query(
                conditions: [
                  C('age').int.equalTo(152),
                  C('lastName').string.equalTo('Hazel'),
                ],
                queryScript: "firstName == 'Jack'",
                returnSingle: true,
              ),
            },
          ),
        },
      );
```

The `Schema` is input to a `CloudCodeGenerator`, which generates server-side javascript to manage the server schema, permissions and validation code.  This supports initial deployment and application upgrades[^1].

<Info>This code generation is currently limited to Back4App, although in theory it could be extended to other backends.  To do so is not currently a project priority, but contributions are welcome</Info>

### Script

A `Script` is the client side element, which is mostly about presenting data to the user, or the user editing that data.

It uses the `Schema`, to avoid discrepancies between client and server side code, especially when clients may be operating on differing versions.

The `Script` provides client-side validation, and allows the developer to, for example, hide or disable components that display data that the end user does not have permission to view.

It also provides default behaviour that suits many situations, over and above that provided by Flutter.  For example, read / edit / save / cancel functionality is available with minimal developer effort.

Currently, the Takkan app runs a `Script` in an "interpreted" mode.  However, it is recognised that this may have some performance limitations for the more demanding apps.

### Builder

In the event that performance becomes an issue, it is intended that a `Builder` would generate native Flutter code from the `Script`.  This would remove any need for interpreting the `Script` at run time, but would lose the flexibility of the being able to dynamically download a version update of the `Script`.

This aspect of the project has not been started, and will only become a priority if performance does actually become an issue.


[^1]: This does require the version upgrades are backward compatible.
